class ViewTools_NN():
    
    # function printFeatureMapsForLayer
    # Description: 
    #   printFeatureMapsForLayer prints the outputs, the featuremaps of a layer.
    #   If x_test_flat (one hot vectors) is not used for training the network, 
    #   just fill in None for x_test_flat. The images in x_test will be used instead.
    #   If you use x_test_flat, still provide x_test, to allow the corresponding input image in 2D (non flattened).
    #   (which is easier for us humans to interpret)
    # Parameters:
    #   nLayer 
    #       this is the layer for which you'd like to print/view the output/featuremap.
    #   x_test_flat 
    #       this is the numpy array with flattened input images. 
    #       Only use this if you flattened the input images. If not, fill in None.
    #   x_test
    #       this is the numpy array with input images. It is assumed/required that each image has the 
    #       next shape: (width,height,nofBytesPerPixel)
    #       ... so far, I've only tested this function for cases where nofBytesPerPixel==1
    #   sampleIndex
    #       this is the index of the input image for which you'd like to inspect the
    #       layer outputs (images) of the specified layer.
    #   baseFilenameForSave
    #       this is the base filename (without extension) that you'd like to save to (as png).
    #       for example, if you specify "c:\featuremapOutput_", then outputfiles like featuremapOutput_1.png 
    #       are saved to your c root. if you leave out the path, the outputfiles will be saved to 
    #       the local directory.
    #       If you specify None, the layer images will not be saved.
    # Note:
    #   The subscribt _test is used to show that we're talking about a sampleset.
    #   Of course, the train sets can be used equally well.
